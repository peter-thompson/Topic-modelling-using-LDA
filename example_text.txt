A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I
cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."
